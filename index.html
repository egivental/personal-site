            My Name is Emile Givental. This website is a work in progress, but I hope you can find some basics about me here in the meantime. <br> <br>

            After recently completing my M.S.E. in Computer Science at The University of Pennsylvania, and my Double Major in Computer and Computer Science from 
            Haverford and Bryn Mawr before that, I am looking for work as a software engineer and/or data scientist. I am focusing my search for in person position 
            in the San Francisco Bay Area, but am open to considering other locations. <br><br>

            As an undergraduate student, I opted to spend my summers doing research in machine learning instead of pursuing internships. At the time, I was more 
            interested in the theoretical side of computer science and was strongly considering pursuing a PhD. 
            Once I decided to pursue Software Engineering nearing the completion of my time at Haverford, I did not find a internship for the summer of 2020 due to Covid. While internship experience alluded me, I prioritized taking project oriented courses all throughout my time at Haverford and The University of Pennsylvania. I am also a quick learner, hard worker, and clear communicator, which led to me always completing my solo and group projects no matter the exigency. <br><br>

            Personally, I love watching sports (baseball and soccer mostly), finding the best happy hours, and am trying to learn how to cook -- read recipes without screwing them up. <br><br> 

            Also, feel free to contact me with the info on my contact page.
