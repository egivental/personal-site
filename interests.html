        My Name is Emile Givental. This website is a work in progress, but I hope you can find out more about me here in the meantime. 

        I am currently looking for work in the San Francisco Bay Area as a Software Engineer. 
        On the About page, you can find a link to my resume and transcripts. You can find links to some code from projects I completed in school and on my own on the Projects page.

        Also, feel free to contact me with the info on my contact page.
